#  Quizzler

This is a little project that I developed in the nine section of Angela Yu's IOS development <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank">course</a>. The goal of this tutorial was to introduce me to the holy frail of mobile design patterns, the Model View Controller(MVC) pattern. Therefore, I built a trivia quiz app.

#  Destini

This is a project that I developed in the section 10 of Angela Yu's IOS development <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank">course</a>. The goal of this challenge is to get you comfortable with implementing the MVC design pattern and thinking about the state of your app. 
Therefore, I created a “choose your own adventure” game similar to the App Store hit “Life Line” app. The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be fleshed out and modified to provide an engaging story-telling experience.
